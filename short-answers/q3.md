# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism means "many forms" and is a concept in OOP where when a class inherits the methods and properties of a Parent class, it can use them just like the parent class can but can also come out with different values and can be implemented differently.
```js
class Animal {
    sound() {
        return "Some animal sound"
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    sound() {
        return "bark!"
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    sound() {
        return "Meow"
    }
}

const makeSound = (animal) => {
    console.log(animal.sound())
}

let rover = new Dog()
let mittens = new Cat()

makeSound(rover)
makeSound(mittens)
```
