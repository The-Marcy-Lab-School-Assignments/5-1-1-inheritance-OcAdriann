# Question

In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  getName() {
    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name}!`)
  }
}

class Male extends Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        super(name, age)
        this.gender = "male"
    }
    code() {
      super.getName()
      console.log(`I am a ${this.gender} and I am ${this.age} years old.`)
    }
}
```
